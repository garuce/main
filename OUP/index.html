            Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish software engineer who is the
            creator and, historically, the lead developer of the Linux kernel,
            used by Linux distributions and other operating systems such as
            Android. He also created the distributed version control system Git.

        <h2>Autobiography</h2>
        <p class="columns">
          Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, the son of journalists Anna
          and Nils Torvalds, the grandson of statistician Leo TÃ¶rnqvist and of
          poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier
          Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University of
          Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking
          minority in Finland. He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel
          Prize-winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux
          and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was
          named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that
          this made him "half Nobel Prize-winning chemist and half
          blanket-carrying cartoon character". Torvalds attended the University
          of Helsinki from 1988 to 1996, graduating with a master's degree in
          computer science from the NODES research group. His academic career
          was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the
          Finnish Navy Nyland Brigade in the summer of 1989, selecting the
          11-month officer training program to fulfill the mandatory military
          service of Finland. He gained the rank of second lieutenant, with the
          role of an artillery observer. He bought computer science professor
          Andrew Tanenbaum's book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation,
          in which Tanenbaum describes MINIX, an educational stripped-down
          version of Unix. In 1990, Torvalds resumed his university studies, and
          was exposed to Unix for the first time in the form of a DEC MicroVAX
          running ULTRIX. His MSc thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating
          System.His interest in computers began with a VIC-20 at the age of 11
          in 1981. He started programming for it in BASIC, then later by
          directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code (he did not utilize
          assembly language).[15] He then purchased a Sinclair QL, which he
          modified extensively, especially its operating system. "Because it was
          so hard to get software for it in Finland", he wrote his own assembler
          and editor "(in addition to Pac-Man graphics libraries" for the QL,
          and a few games. He wrote a Pac-Man clone, Cool Man. On 5 January 1991
          he purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC before receiving his
          MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux.
